Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have no pending migrations, run:

     rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development

  2. Add the following to your routes.rb file:
  
     mount Conschedule::Engine, at: "/"

     (NOTE: You may mount it at any path, not just "/")

  3. If you wish to authenticate listing page with Devise, it would look something like:

     authenticate :admin do
       get "/admin/schedules" => "conschedule/schedules#index"
     end   

  4. Ensure you have set 'from_address' and 'contact_name' in config/initializers/conschedule.rb
  
     config.from_address = "foo@example.com"
     config.contact_name = "foo" 

  5. If you wish to receive confirmation and cancel mails, ensure you have set following config variables in config/initializers/conschedule.rb:

     config.send_confirmation_mail = true
     config.send_cancel_mail = true
     config.to_address = "foo@example.com"

  6. You can copy Conschedule views (for customization) to your app by running:

       rails g conschedule:views

                OR

       rails g conschedule:views -v form listing mailer
